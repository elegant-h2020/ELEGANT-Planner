let's visualize first the ones from gpu.


GPU:

> dungani in total: 237(uncompiled) and 165(compiled)
> dungani_QuadroTesla_exp1 (downloaded)
> dungani_QuadroTesla_exp2 (downloaded)
	initial dataset from config (146, 8)
	compiled kernels (55, 8)
	uncompiled kernels (91, 8)
	 


> epyc7 in total: 234(uncompiled) and 166(compiled)
> epyc7_NvidiaA100_exp1 (downloaded)
> epyc7_NvidiaA100_exp2 (downloaded)
	initial dataset from config (144, 8)
	compiled kernels (54, 8)
	uncompiled kernels (90, 8)



> silver1_Tesla_exp1 (downloaded)
	initial dataset from config (256, 8)
	compiled kernels (110, 8)
	uncompiled kernels (146, 8)



> silver1_Tesla_exp2 (downloaded)
	initial dataset from config (146, 8)
	compiled kernels (56, 8)
	uncompiled kernels (90, 8)



(for gold2 I have gpu and cpu together)
> gold2_GeForceGTX_IntelXeonCPU_exp1 (downloaded)
	initial dataset from config (256, 8)
	compiled kernels (120, 8)
	uncompiled kernels (136, 8)



> gold2_GeForceGTX_IntelXeonCPU_exp2 (downloaded)
	initial dataset from config (136, 8)
	compiled kernels (48, 8)
	uncompiled kernels (88, 8)
