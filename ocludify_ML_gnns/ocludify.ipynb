    "## OpenCL kernel execution time measurement with `oclude` ###\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This script runs the `oclude` profiler (which must be installed, obviously) on a list of OpenCL kernels and times them. To run, it expects **3 files**:\n",
    "   - a CSV file with the list of kernels to run (see **2.** below)\n",
    "   - a CSV file with the list of configurations to use for each kernel (see **3.** below)\n",
    "   - a simple text file with the list of OpenCL devices to run the kernels on (see **4.** below)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. These OpenCL kernels are expected to be stored in a CSV file with the following required columns:\n",
    "   - `benchmark`: the name of the kernel\n",
    "   - `src`: the actual source code of the kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "   No other column is taken into account.\n",
    "   The name of this CSV is stored in the constant `KERNELS_FILE` in the **GLOBAL VARIABLES SECTION** (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The script expects one more CSV file with its name stored in the `CONFIG_FILE` global variable with the following columns:\n",
    "   - `benchmark`: the name of the kernel (which must match the name of one of the kernels in the `KERNELS_FILE`)\n",
    "   - `config`: the configuration to use for the kernel (see **5.** below)\n",
    "   - `gsizes`: a space-separated list of 3 integers that defines the global sizes to use for the kernel. The format is: `<starting value (inclusive)> <ending value (inclusive)> <step>`. Note that each global size corresponds to a different run. If left empty, the default global sizes will be used (see constant `DEFAULT_GSIZES` in the **GLOBAL VARIABLES SECTION**).\n",
    "   - `samples`: the number of samples to take for each run of the kernel i.e., the number of times the kernel will be executed. If left empty, the default number of samples will be used (see constant `DEFAULT_SAMPLES` in the **GLOBAL VARIABLES SECTION**).\n",
    "   - `devices`: a space-separated list of OpenCL devices to run the kernel on. The device names must match the names of the devices in the `DEVICES_FILE` (see **4.** below). If left empty, all devices in the `DEVICES_FILE` will be used.\n",
    "   - `timeouts`: a space-separated list of timeout values (in seconds) to use for the kernel. If left empty, the default timeouts will be used (see constant `DEFAULT_TIMEOUTS` in the **GLOBAL VARIABLES SECTION**). Because the execution of `oclude` can hang if there is a problem with the inputs or the value of the gsize (which is not at all unusual), the script will have to kill the kernel's execution. The timeout values are used to determine when to kill the execution. If more than one value is specified (like in the default value), the script will try as many times as there are timeout values before giving up. If there is a run that succeeds before reaching its respective timeout, the script will continue with the next run, and the remaining timeout values will be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ***IMPORTANT NOTE***: the script will only deal with the kernels listed in the `CONFIG_FILE`, regardless of how many kernels are listed in the `KERNELS_FILE`. This is because the `CONFIG_FILE` is expected to be manually edited by the user to specify the kernels to run and their respective configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The script expects a simple text file with the list of OpenCL devices to run the kernels on.\n",
    "   - Each line in the file describes a different device to use. All the experiments will be run on each device.\n",
    "   - Each line must be a space-separated list of 3 values with the following format: `<custom device name> <platform id> <device id>`.\n",
    "   - The custom device name is used to identify the device in the output files (e.g. CPU, GPU1, GPU2, etc.). Must be unique and **cannot contain spaces**.\n",
    "   - The platform id and device id are the values returned by the OpenCL API when querying the available devices.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     Let's say that we run the command `clinfo -l` and get the following output:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Platform #0: Intel(R) OpenCL\n",
    "      `-- Device #0: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 5120 CPU @ 2.20GHz\n",
    "     Platform #1: NVIDIA CUDA\n",
    "      +-- Device #0: GeForce GTX 1060 6GB\n",
    "      `-- Device #1: GeForce GTX 1060 6GB\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Then, if we want to use all 3 devices, the file should contain the following lines:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     CPU 0 0\n",
    "     GPU1 1 0\n",
    "     GPU2 1 1\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - The name of this file is stored in the constant `DEVICES_FILE` in the **GLOBAL VARIABLES SECTION**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How to configure the experiments per kernel:\n",
    "   Because the execution of OpenCL kernels with random inputs is quite difficult to automate, the script expects the user to manually include/exclude kernels. This is done by specifying the configuration to use for each kernel in the `CONFIG_FILE`, under the `config` column. The configuration is a string. The following configurations are supported:\n",
    "   - empty: if all kernels have an empty config value, the script will run all of them.\n",
    "   - `<` and `>`: the script will run all kernels between the first `<` and the first `>` (both inclusive). All other kernels will be ignored. All config values of kernels outside this range will be ignored. All other range configs will be ignored. The (other) config values of kernels inside this range will be taken into account. These config options can be combined with others (e.g. `<!`).\n",
    "   - `X`: the script will skip this kernel.\n",
    "   - `!`: if there is at least one kernel with a `!` config value, the script will run this/these kernel(s) only. If range configs are used (`<` and `>`), the `!` config values will be ignored, unless there is at least one kernel with a `!` config value inside the specified range. In that case, the script will run only the kernels with a `!` config value inside the specified range. It is ignored if combined with the `X` config value (the kernel will be skipped regardless).\n",
    "   - Note that, in the provided configuration file, there are 61 kernels marked to be skipped (i.e., with an `X` in the `config` column). These are kernels that cannot be compiled/run by `oclude`. They were just present in the provided `KERNELS_FILE`. Feel free to completely remove these rows from the `CONFIG_FILE` if you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The script will generate a single CSV results file. The name of the file is stored in the constant `RESULTS_FILE` in the **GLOBAL VARIABLES SECTION**. If left empty, the name will be `results_<timestamp>.csv`, where the timestamp is the current date and time in the format specified by the constant `TIMESTAMP_FORMAT` in the **GLOBAL VARIABLES SECTION**."
